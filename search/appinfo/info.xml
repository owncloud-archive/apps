	<description>Allows users to interact with search results (e.g. delete, share) using the same view available in the Files app. Much like iTunes, you can interact with your search results in a file list. It uses the current search providers available ownCloud (i.e. they only search by file name) but I plan to start building more search providers soon. This project is still in beta testing; please submit all bugs or feature requests to https://github.com/andrewsbrown/owncloud-core/issues.</description>
