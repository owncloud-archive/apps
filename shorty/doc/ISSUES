This is a short list of known issues:

- for ownCloud 5 based installations there is an issue with the validation of 
the setup for the static backend. Due to tightened security rules the validation 
strategy fail in cross domain setups. 

- Shorty does not completely work with the khtml rendering engine (konqueror browser).
Konqueror using webkit engine works fine though. This issue is unlikely to be
fixed, since the problem originates in the jQuery library not supporting the
khtml engine.

- There are some issues when using Shorty with a MS IE browser:
MS IE versions prior to 9 are not supported at all, those browsers simply violate 
too many web standards. From version 9 onwards Shorty is usable, but a few 
issues remain:
* some style glitches like missing rounded corners in dialogs fieldset frames.
* text payloads inside the usage popups in the sharing dialog won't be preselected.
These and probably many more issues are the result of the fact that this browser
still is not as compatible to wide spread standards as other, competetive browsers.
Things improved over the last years, but a lot remains to get fixed and brushed by
Microsoft. Though I actually hesitate to expect that these issues really will get
sorted out. Microsoft has endlessly played the game of 'nearly' being compatible
over the past decades to keep users in their monopolistic and progress blocking
grip. I doubt they really changed. Why should they? People still throw money at
them despite the bad quality of their products and the brutness of their behaviour.
So: sorry for users of that browser. Not your fault, but complain at Microsoft.
