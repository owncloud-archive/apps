Planned features for ocsvg (SVG editor for ownCloud) as of 0.2-beta6

beta:
 * more saving options (PDF meta information, ...)
 * multiple PDF pages (e.g. split by layer, render single pages)
 * include images into exported PDF (if possible with jsPDF)
 * better integration of svg-edit features (doc properties etc.)
 * support for ownCloud 4 (if not downwards compatible, make it a seperate app)

1.0:
 * file picker dialogs for image/svg import and saving
 * l10n (set svg-edit language to the current owncloud language)

Ideas for the future:
 * collaborative editing (e.g. with input field for etherpad lite pad URL)
 * PDF export of more element types (paths, gradients, arrows etc. if possible)
