Description:
	This app enables you to view, create and modify SVG files inside
	the ownCloud user interface. It's also great as a tool for creating
	PDF files and PNG graphics.

Installation:
	Copy this folder to your ownCloud's /apps/ directory, rename it to
	"files_svgedit" and enable the app in the admin interface. Or use
	the official ownCloud app repo (appstore) for the latest stable version.

Usage:
	To edit an SVG file, simply click on it in your directory listing.
	Saving, exporting and downloading can be done when clicking "Save"
	in the editor.

Updating svg-edit:
    To get the latest trunk version of svg-edit, go to files_svgedit/
    and execute the following commands:

		rm -rf svg-edit
        svn export http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/editor svg-edit
        cp svg-edit/embedapi.js js/svg-edit/
    
    But you should first check if there've been changes to the svg-edit
    project that could make it incompatible to ocsvg!
