	<description>Activate this app when you want to be
		able to find files by searching their content.
		The implementation does not search the files
		directly but will build a so called 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_index">reverse index</a>.<br/><br/>
		Currently only your personal files will be indexed,
		and only you index is searched, so you will not be able
		to find files that have been shared with you or that
		reside on remote mount points.<br/><br/>
		Every time a file has been written owncloud will
		index it in the background. Furthermore, when
		clicking the search box it will check if any
		files need indexing. This might add a lot of
		background jobs after first enabling this app,
		depending on the amount of files you have.<br/><br/>
		Even thought file indexing is in progress you will
		still be able to retrieve file search results for any
		indexed files.<br/><br/>
		We currenty support plain text, HTML and PDF files.
		MS Office 2007 and Open/Libre Office are on the roadmap.
