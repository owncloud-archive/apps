		This application allows an admin to add a link in the ownCloud web interface Apps menu that points to an external website. By simply entering the URL and the name for the external site, icon appears. When this icon is clicked by a user, the external website appears in the ownCloud frame. For the user, this external site appears as if it is part of ownCloud but, in fact, this can be any external URL.
Note that the External Site link must use the same type of encryption as provided by ownCloud. In other words, if ownCloud is hosted on HTTPS, the link in the external site must also be HTTPS. The same is also true for HTTP. More information is available in the External Sites documentation.
