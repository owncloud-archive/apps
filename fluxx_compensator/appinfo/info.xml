	<description>
		This simple app offers control over the navigation panel and compensates effects on the main content area, thus the name 'FluXX Compensator (Y)'.
		It adds a handler to the header and navigation panels that allows to slide the panels in and out of view. This helps to gain valuable space on small displays.
		Simply click the handler to hide/show the navigation panel. To move the handler to where you want it to be, just hold the handler and drag it.
		The older amongst us will know where the name 'FluXX Compensator (Y)' comes from... ;-)
