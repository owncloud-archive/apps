This is a short list of known issues:

- Safari (at least under MS-Windows) shows a slow reaction when clicking a handle. 
This is due to the fact that Safari only reacts on a timeout based safety catch, 
whilst other browsers react in a load event raised when the transition style 
rules are present. Aparently Safari simply does not raise such event...
