The current status of this package is as follows:

This initial release might be buggy and contain annoying shortcomings.
It has been developed on a linux system using only a few widespread browsers,
so this is most likely the best working combination. Basic usage test have been
made with a few other browsers. The package appears to be working in general
though there might be some minor differences in apeparance.

So "sorry for any inconveniences" !

Contributions:
I'd be more than happy to welcome all contributions to this little experiment.
Drop me a note, an idea, a patch, a good bottle of wine, anything !
