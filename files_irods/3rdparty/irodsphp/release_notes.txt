The PRODS PHP Web Browser is also included in this project, and remains supported.  Note that the PHP Web Browser functionality has been subsumed by the idrop-web browser and idrop-swing client. 

Please go to [[https://code.renci.org/gf/project/irodsphp/] for the latest news and info.

Note that the git repository is now the canonical version of the PHP code.  The code in the iRODS SVN server is deprecated and will be taken down at the 3.0.0 release point.  There may be other versions in Google Code and other places, but these should be considered obsolete.

Please review release notes in sub projects for details
