There are only two configuration aspects:
1.) the content of the legal notice
2.) the position of the reference of the legal notice
Both aspects are currently configured in the systems admin section. There is a
direct link to that section if you open the app without having configured it
before.

The content can be plain text, or markdown or html markup can be applied. Also,
html style attributes are accepted, though they must be specified inside the
markup. Dealing with separate style definitions appears unneccessary overhead
for this small purpose.

Currently five positions are offered, where to place the reference to the notice:
Left or right in the header, bottom left or right in login or guest views and
simply as a standalone app in the navigation.
