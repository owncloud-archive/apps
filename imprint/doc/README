This imprint app implements a plugin for the ownCloud web application.
It provides a very simply means to add a legal notice, an imprint to the
framework. Such notice is required in some countries when offering a service
on the internet.
The app is kept extremely simple. No fancy configuration options, no complex
setup. Just activate it, configure the notices content and where to place the
reference, that's all.
You can use plain text for content or use simple html layout.
